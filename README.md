And there is also a Node Red server backend which is handels comminication between PLCs and Firebase Database. I have added the node red flow inside to backend folder.
I used some packages to communicate with plc and firebase but i developed this project long while ago so i didn't remember that package names. 
But probably you can find them to search like siemens, plc etc.
